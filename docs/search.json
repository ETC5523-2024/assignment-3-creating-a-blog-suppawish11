This figure is also twice the amount launched by Russia, which ranks second. The US’s dominance in space object launches is a direct result of its significant advancements in space technology, driven by substantial investments in research and development. This commitment to innovation has enabled the US to outpace other nations and maintain its leadership in space exploration."

However, after 1995, Russia’s launch rate began to decline, while the US saw a remarkable surge in its space activity. The turning point came after 2015, when the US’s launch rate began to grow exponentially. By 2020, the US had outpaced Russia, becoming the leading country in space object launches. That year alone, the US launched nearly 1,000 units into orbit, a number that continued to rise every year. By 2023, the US had launched over 2,000 units, securing its dominant position in space exploration. With a cumulative total of almost 10,000 space objects in orbit, the US has firmly established itself as the global leader in space object launches."

    "text": "Factors influencing the growth\nThe United States has experienced a remarkable growth in the number of space objects launched into orbit. There are several factors that influences the success of the advancement of space technology industry of the US that highlights the US’s competitive advantage over other nations, attributed to the implementation of progressive national space policies and substantial government funding.\nNASA plays a key role in this progress as a government-owned agency focused on research and the development of new technology in space (NASA 2022).\nNew National Space Policy supports NASA’s programs, helping shape the future of space technology by encouraging more innovation in the U.S. space industry (Sadin, Povinelli, and Rosen 1989).\nInvestment Funding for Research and Development, shown in Figure 3, gives NASA the ability to invest in long-term projects that lead to better technology and more space object launches (Sadin, Povinelli, and Rosen 1989).\nAs a result, the US strengthens its position as a leader in space exploration and technology, improving its capabilities in space research. These developments improve the US’s capability to conduct research and helping it continue to innovate in the fast-changing space industry (Sadin, Povinelli, and Rosen 1989)."
