Object is including with satellites, probes, landers, crewed spacecraft, and space station elements. The variables that will be used in this blog are the following:\n\nEntity: This contains country name, continent, and other entity.\nYear: Time period from 1957 - 2023.\nannual_launched: Annual number of objects launched into space.\n\nThe second data set used in this analysis is from Our World in Data. This data contained the budget data is adjusted for inflation to their dollar values in the fiscal year 2020. All adjustments for inflation are made using the GDP Chained Price Index published by the US Office of Management and Budget. The variables that will be used in this blog are the following:\n\nEntity: This contains country name, continent, and other entity.\nYear: Time period from 1957 - 2023.\nBudget: Annual budget of NASA.\n\nThe following alteration has been implemented:\n\nBoth data sets use select function to deselect the unneeded variable which is the entity code.\nUsing rename function in the annual objects launched dataset to rename the varible for simple use.\n\n\n\nCode\nspace &lt;- read_csv(\"data/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space.csv\") |&gt; \n  rename(\"annual_launched\" = \"Annual number of objects launched into outer space\") |&gt; \n  select(-Code)\n\nnasa &lt;- read_csv(\"data/nasa-annual-budget.csv\") |&gt; \n  select(-Code)"

That number is also doubled the amount of Russia, the second place in the ranking. This number is coming from the advancement of space technology within the country of the US, where they invest a large amount of money into research and technology.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Cumulative number of objects launched into outer space each year\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 2, time-series shows the cumulative total number of objects launched into space orbit in each year, which in the early time period, Russia was the top country that launched the highest number of space objects for almost 50 years from 1973 until 2019. However, after 1995, the launch rate of Russia decrease and the US’s launch rate was going the opposite, where the significant increase that can be seen cleary after 2015 that the US’s launch rate grow exponentially. In 2020, the year that US was able to outpace Russia and become the country with the highest space object launched. The US launched almost 1,000 units of space objects, and this number increased every year until 2023 where they launched more than 2,000 units into space orbit resulting in the US being the leading of the countries in the total number of space objects.This growth strengthened the US’s position as the leading country in space object launches, with a cumulative total of almost 10,000 units in 2023."

    "text": "The rapid increase in the number of space objects launched by the United States raises significant questions about the sustainability and management of space activities. With over 2,000 objects sent into space between 2020 and 2023, the U.S. has outpaced all other nations combined, highlighting a competitive advantage driven by advancements in technology, changes in national space policy, and substantial government investment. This expansion offers several advantages, including enhanced scientific research through improved data collection and better monitoring capabilities. However, this growth comes with challenges, such as potential overpopulation in Earth’s orbit, increased risks of collisions, and the need for effective regulation for the responsible use of space."
