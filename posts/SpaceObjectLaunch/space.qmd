## Problem description  
The rapid increase in the number of space objects launched by the United States raises significant questions about the sustainability and management of space activities. With over 2,000 objects sent into space between 2020 and 2023, the U.S. has outpaced all other nations combined, highlighting a competitive advantage driven by technological advancement, changes in national space policy, and substantial government investment. This expansion offers several benefits, including enhanced scientific research through improved data collection and better monitoring capabilities. 

## Data description

The first data set used in this analysis is from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space?facet=none#explore-the-data). The data set contains information about annual number of objects launched into space. The object includes satellites, probes, landers, crewed spacecraft, and space station elements [@owid-space-exploration-satellites].
The variables that will be used in this blog are the following:

- Entity: This contains the country name, continent, and other entity. 
- Year: Time period from 1957 - 2023. 
- annual_launched: Annual number of objects launched into space. 

The second data set used in this analysis is from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/nasa-annual-budget). This data contained the budget data adjusted for inflation to their dollar values in the fiscal year 2020. All adjustments for inflation are made using the GDP Chained Price Index published by the US Office of Management and Budget [@owid-space-exploration-satellites]. The variables that will be used in this blog are the following:

- Entity: This contains the country name, continent, and other entity. 
- Year: Time period from 1957 - 2023. 
- Budget: Annual budget of NASA.

The following alterations has been implemented:

- Both data sets use the `select` function to deselect the unneeded variable which is the entity code.
- Using the `rename` function in the annual objects launched dataset to rename the variable for simple use.

```{r data}
#| code-fold: true
#| echo: true
space <- read_csv("data/yearly-number-of-objects-launched-into-outer-space.csv") |> 
  rename("annual_launched" = "Annual number of objects launched into outer space") |> 
  select(-Code)

nasa <- read_csv("data/nasa-annual-budget.csv") |> 
  select(-Code)
```

## Total number of objects launched into outer space

```{r}
#| label: tbl-rank
#| tbl-cap: "Top 10 entities with the highest space objects launched"
space |> 
  group_by(Entity) |> 
  summarise(Total_launched = sum(annual_launched)) |> 
  arrange(-Total_launched) |> 
  filter(!Entity == "World") |> 
  head(10) |> 
  mutate(Rank = row_number()) |> 
  select(Rank, Entity) |> 
  kable(col.names = c("Rank", "Entity"), align = "ll") |> 
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) |> 
  column_spec(1, width = "40%") |>   
  column_spec(2, width = "60%")  
```

@tbl-rank shows a ranking of countries and entities based on the total number of space objects launched, highlighting the United States as the leader in space exploration. Following the US, Russia and China hold the second and third positions, respectively. This rank shows a mix of large regions contributing to the space object launched.

```{r}
#| label: fig-total_object
#| fig-cap: "Total number of objects launched into outer space"
#| fig.height: 3
  
space |> 
  group_by(Entity) |> 
  summarise(Total_launched = sum(annual_launched)) |> 
  arrange(-Total_launched) |> 
  head(6) |> 
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_reorder(Entity, Total_launched), x = Total_launched)) +
  geom_col() +
  geom_col(data = ~filter(.x, Entity =="United States"),
           fill = "#006DAE")+
  geom_text(aes(label = Total_launched, hjust = -0.2)) +
  lims(x = c(0, 20000)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Total number of objects launched into outer space",
       y = "Country") 
  
```

As shown in @fig-total_object, the United States has launched more than half of the total space objects sent into orbit by all countries combined. This figure is also twice the amount launched by Russia, which ranks second. The US’s dominance in space object launches is a direct result of its significant advancements in space technology, driven by substantial investments in research and development. This commitment to innovation has enabled the US to outpace other nations and maintain its leadership in space exploration.

## The United States taken the lead
```{r}
#| label: fig-total_object-ts
#| fig-cap: "Cumulative number of objects launched into outer space each year"
cumu_df <- space |> 
  group_by(Entity) |> 
  mutate(cumulative_launch = cumsum(annual_launched)) |> 
  filter(Entity %in% c("United States", "Russia", "China", "United Kingdom", "Japan"))

cumu_df |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,
             y = cumulative_launch,
             color = fct_reorder(Entity, cumulative_launch, .fun = max, .desc = TRUE))) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(size = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Total object launched",
       color = "Country")  +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1960, 2030, by = 5), 
                     limits = c(1960, 2030)) +
  geom_text(data = cumu_df |> 
              group_by(Entity) |> 
              filter(Year == max(Year)), 
            aes(label = Entity),
            hjust = -0.1,
            vjust = 0.5,
            size = 2)  +
  theme_minimal()
```

In @fig-total_object-ts, it can be seen that for nearly 50 years, from 1973 until 2019, Russia held the top position as the country with the highest number of space object launches. However, after 1995, Russia's launch rate began to decline, while the US saw a remarkable surge in its space activity. The turning point came after 2015 when the US’s launch rate began to grow exponentially. By 2020, the US had outpaced Russia, becoming the leading country in space object launches. That year alone, the US launched nearly 1,000 units into orbit, a number that continued to rise every year. By 2023, the US had launched over 2,000 units, securing its dominant position in space exploration. With a cumulative total of almost 10,000 space objects in orbit, the US has firmly established itself as the global leader in space object launches.


## NASA Annual Budget
```{r}
#| label: fig-nasa-budget
#| fig-cap: "Annual budget of NASA"
nasa |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = Year,
             y = Budget/1000000000)) +
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(aes(y = Budget/1000000000), size = 1) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(y = "Annual Budget ($Billion)") +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(1960, 2022, by = 5), 
                     limits = c(1960, 2023)) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 40, by = 5))
```

NASA's significant budget investment, as shown in @fig-nasa-budget, has allowed for substantial long-term research and development efforts, averaging $20 billion annually over the last two decades. This consistent funding has fueled cumulative advancements in technology, improving NASA's mission capabilities and increasing the number of space objects launched into orbit. Moreover, developing cutting-edge technologies often necessitates extensive infrastructure, including specialized laboratories and equipment, which further supports innovation and technology development efforts [@sadinNASATECHNOLOGYPUSH1989].

## Factors influencing the growth

The United States has experienced a remarkable growth in the number of space objects launched into orbit.  There are several factors that influence the success of the advancement of the space technology industry of the US that highlight the US's competitive advantage over other nations, attributed to the implementation of progressive national space policies and substantial government funding. 

**NASA** plays a key role in this progress as a government-owned agency focused on research and the development of new technology in space [@nasaNASANASA2022]. 

**New National Space Policy** supports NASA’s programs, helping shape the future of space technology by encouraging more innovation in the U.S. space industry [@sadinNASATECHNOLOGYPUSH1989]. 

**Investment Funding for Research and Development**, shown in @fig-nasa-budget, gives NASA the ability to invest in long-term projects that lead to better technology and more space object launches [@sadinNASATECHNOLOGYPUSH1989].

As a result, the US strengthens its position as a leader in space exploration and technology, improving its capabilities in space research. These developments improve the US's capability to conduct research and help it continue to innovate in the fast-changing space industry [@sadinNASATECHNOLOGYPUSH1989].
